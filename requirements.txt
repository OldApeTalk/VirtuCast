# Core Dependencies
# NOTE:
# - Unreal Engine's Python API (module `unreal`) is bundled with the UE Editor and
#   is NOT installed via pip in this venv.
# - If you're using a very new Python (e.g. 3.14), some binary wheels may not be
#   available yet; those deps are guarded with markers and will be installed once
#   you move to a supported Python (commonly 3.10/3.11).
